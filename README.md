# Library Development & Testing

This repository and project is meant to be used for developing the team's library that is used in all of our robot projects and to test library/new code during the offseason.
~~The stuff that needs to be created/tested should be kept track of in the TODO.md file.~~
For now refer to the task board (Agile) unless this doesn't exist in the future then go back to a todo list.
Also uh don't get lazy with commit messages like I do.
