# Library Development & Testing

This repository and project is meant to be used for developing the team's library that is used in all of our robot projects and to test library/new code during the offseason.
The stuff that needs to be created/tested should be kept track of in the TODO.md file.
Also uh don't get lazy with commit messages like I do.
