# Lib Dev:

- Print Util
    - Pretty printing variable names with variable values
- Logger
    - ~~Basic logging to NT~~
    - Subsystem logging default template (ex: current commands)
    - Anyone can log stuff to network tables using our class which automatically gets put into the log file
    - Use AdvantageScope to visualize this data
- Motion Magic Interface (Maybe baseclass?)
    - ~~Basic Implementation~~
    - I want really easy integration with motion magic, just supply motors and some constants.
    - ~~Should also make use of Talon Configs for easy constants classes~~
- Improve python vision code
    - Clean up
    - Fix network tables code for newer versions of NT
- Falcon Music Class
    - ~~Basic Implementation~~
- Smart Joystick
    - ~~Basic Implementation~~
    - ~~Should throw an exception the second you try to map multiple buttons to the same thing so it doesn't happen during running the robot~~
- Maybe experiment with a base command class that isn't interruptible by default
    - Class created
    - ~~This also means we need to ensure that the user has a way to stop commands (RobotContainer#stopEverything)~~
